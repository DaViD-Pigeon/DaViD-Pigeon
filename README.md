## Hi there üëã

Hi, I'm **Changhao Pan (ÊΩòÊò∂Áöì)**! 

I am a senior student at at [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence. I am part of the [Turing Class](http://www.en.cs.zju.edu.cn/turing_honors_class/list.htm), a program jointly established by [Chu Kochen Honors College](ckc.zju.edu.cn) and College of Computer Science and Technology.

Currently I am a student research assistant at Audio Research Team at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhou Zhao](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou).

My research interest includes **Multi-Modal Generative AI, Multi-Modal Language Processing and Text-to-Audio Synthesis**. Now I focus on the Stylised and personalised Singing Voice Synthesis and Music Large Language Model. 

**I am actively looking for academic collaboration and research intern, feel free to drop me an email.**
